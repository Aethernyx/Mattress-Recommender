This repo was built to provide a recommendation for the best Mattress for an individual based on certain features.
The model was built using 22,000+ reviews of various mattresses currently available.
This repo contains the model, a notebook with a function built out to collect all of the review text data, the Flask web application, the exploratory data analysis.

The culmination of this project is a deployed model available to use at https://mattress-recommender.herokuapp.com/
